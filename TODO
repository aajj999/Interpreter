Before sending:
-name of folder Anna_Jablonowska
-delete useless files
-zip Anna_Jablonowska.zip
-check all good examples on students

To do now:
-print errors (or delete + in table)

For 2. round:
-where which variables visible
-find more situations of errors (lack of return in function)
-always display positions of errors
-printing by other functions not working
-finish function on return
-unused rules in parser
